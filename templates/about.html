      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>The Eye Risk Prediction System is a data-driven web application designed to assess<br> 
        an individual's risk of developing eye-related health conditions using machine learning techniques. <br>
        By analyzing key physiological and lifestyle parameters<br>
         such as age, eye pressure, retina thickness, vision clarity, sleep patterns, cholesterol, and<br>
          blood sugar levels, the system provides real-time risk predictions categorized as Low, Moderate, or High. <br>
          Built with a user-friendly interface and powered by predictive models <br>
          like Random Forest or Logistic Regression, the platform aims to support early detection and preventive eye care. <br>
          It empowers healthcare professionals with valuable insights and<br>
           enables individuals to take proactive measures toward maintaining optimal eye health.</p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>Users input key health parameters such as age, eye pressure, retina thickness, and lifestyle metrics into the system.
      <br>The application preprocesses the data and uses a trained machine learning model to analyze patterns and predict eye health risk levels.
      <br>Based on the prediction (Low, Moderate, or High), it displays the risk level and visual insights through interactive graphs for better understanding and early action.</p>
